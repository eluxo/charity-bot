# Charity Overlay for BetterPlace Webhook

This has been used during the ESOWZ V, but with some slight modifications
adding a token to the webhook URL and the overlay access, so that it is not
publicly visible.

You can use this code to implement your own interfaces, but be it would
really be a good idea to add secret tokens to all hide it from public
access.
